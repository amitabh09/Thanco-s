                        We strongly believe that retailing will be the next big thing in the ice-cream industry. Ice-cream parlors fit in well with the prevailing and upcoming consumer trends. Indulging will increasingly occupy a significant share of the average Indians wallet. And, ice creams are certainly a very good way to indulge!
